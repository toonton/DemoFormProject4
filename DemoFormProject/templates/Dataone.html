<h2>The DataBase.</h2>
<h3>Pokemon information</h3>

<p>Here is the Database about the pokemons and all theres stats.
    The Name column is just the name of the pokemons nothing spciel.
    The Type 1 and Type 2 columns is just the type of the pokemon but pokemons can have 2 types so this is why we have 2 type columns.
    The Total is just the total stat point of the pokemons means all the stat together the absolute total.
    The HP is the health points of the pokemon.
    The Defense is the defense of the pokemon.
    The Sp. Atk is the special attak of the pokemon or projectiles dmg.
    The Sp. Def is the special defense of the pokemons against projectiles.
    The Speed is the speed of the pokemon.
    I use all of these columns is for the datafarming later when I'm making the graph the user can choose any of these stats and the name is the pokemon.</p>
